What is coagulation? 

Expectant mothers are frightened at the mere spoken word "coagulation". But this is just one of the many compulsory blood tests during pregnancy.
How often it is necessary to hand over what it shows and how to decode it in the paper.

What is coagulation?

The circulatory system during pregnancy needs to be increased attention since her work - an important indicator of health. Coagulation hemostasis checks. It is a system that is responsible for normal blood, including its coagulation during bleeding, to avoid large blood loss, such as during childbirth. If coagulation hemostasis show low, then the person can lose a lot of blood even for small cuts. High rates threaten thrombosis, heart attacks and strokes. Both are dangerous anomalies as to a critical point, e.g., surgery or childbirth, did not show themselves.

Pregnant hemostasis system becomes another. Such restructuring the way nature intended. If there is a third child-bearing circulation - uteroplacental. Since the body prepares for a gradual increase in blood flow, and the inevitable loss of blood during childbirth.

How often do you take coagulation?

The analysis is usually carried out once every trimester. In some cases, more frequently. The need to appear in diseases of the circulatory, immune system, varicose veins ,
liver problems, before or after surgery.

In group risk are   the future mothers with Rhesus negative . Their immune system
perceives its own antibodies as foreign, so fighting with them.

Increased susceptibility to blood clotting requires periodic investigations. Analysis vein taken from fasting (8 must pass hours).

If coagulation was carried out at the wrong time and were found deviations from the norm, there is a high risk of miscarriage or premature birth, and a fetus - disorders of brain function.

Decoding results

Indicators and other coagulation tests decrypts the doctor, as they may vary. For example, in chronic diseases, some data are not correct, but the pregnancy is without complications.

The coagulation consists of 8 indicators. They detect even small deviations:

Fibrinogen (protein). It is an essential part of a blood clot when clotting. Outside pregnancy, its index is at a level of from 2 to 4 g / l. During pregnancy - up to 6 g / l. Elevated levels of danger thrombosis. Lowering happens when toxicosis . Utero-placental circulation increases the level of fibrinogen with each passing month, the maximum occurs at the time of delivery.

APTT stands for period of time for which the blood is minimized. In pregnant women, this interval due to the increase of fibrinogen is 17-20 seconds. Outside of
pregnancy, she curls up for 25-35 seconds.

Thrombin time shows how much lasts the last stage of the blood coagulation. Norm - 11-18 seconds. Due to the increased fibrinogen, thrombin time in pregnancy lasts longer. Deviations indicate malfunctions of the liver.

Prothrombin - a protein found in the blood plasma, it is a precursor of thrombin, forming clots along with other substances. Its quantity determines the density and the ability to timely clotting krovi.V normal concentration of 78-142%. Increased rate of pregnancy marks the beginning of placental abruption. ( What is FPN? The risk of disease development. )

The platelets are formed in bone marrow, blood belong to the elements. During pregnancy may slightly decrease. A sign of the disease is a strong contrast to the norm. Platelet deficit appears on the background of malnutrition or development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (hemostasis system failure).

 D-dimer controls thrombotic process. Factor necessary for the timely
detection trombozov.U pregnant women is normal, he is gradually increasing. The rapid jump indicates diabetes mellitus, kidney disease.

Antithrombin III - a protein that slows down the clotting krovi.Ego level need to constantly monitor if the pregnant woman takes drugs to reduce it. Deviation of 50% may be indicative of the development of thrombosis.  

 Group identifies specific antibodies lupus coagulant. If everything is in order that they should not be. Upon detection of the doctor excludes autoimmune diseases and Rh conflict. Antibodies in the blood often talk about the presence of preeclampsia. This pathology worsens the condition of both.
