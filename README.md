From the complex to revitalize babble

When a child sees an adult, he is animated, smiling back at his smile and even "talking": coo, "coos", whimpers. "Revitalizing complex" occurs in about 2.5 months and means that the baby is developing as it should.

Kid wants to play from an early age. When the mother comes to his attention, he begins to actively move the arms and legs, smile broadly. In the professional environment, this is called a complex animation, and the language of mums and dads "translated" as an invitation to have fun together. And they are happy to respond to the call, but later too lucky enough. Mom plays with the baby, thus proving her love for him. It's better gifts, hugs and verbal assurances are not so convincing to him.

Familiarity with gestures

It is impossible to remain unperturbed when a reviving crumbs when it appeared. However, it is equally important to understand each other. This will help gestures. Scarce quickly grasps their essence, and a little later may have to repeat. For example, known to all, "Hello", "Goodbye!", "Come to me" and others that you can think for yourself, to communicate with crumbs on it accessible for him language. It will be very pleased to receive an answer from the crumbs. Sign language the child will learn faster if you will call at the same time the object and display a sign designating it.

The first months of preparing the ground for the emergence of speech. After all this time actively ripen speech areas of the brain. Speech therapists first year of life is called the pre-speech period. The basic foundation for the development of speech is put to a year, so it is very important to begin to talk, chat and play with your child at this age.

Such different cry

Voice of the kid reacts to what is happening inside and around. If the baby is healthy, his cry and the call is long. The two, three months intonation cry becomes more diverse, as they reflect the state of the crumbs. Thus, the cry of hunger can not be confused with any other - he is insistent and shrill, and cry with discomfort sounds sluggish and inexpressive.

Gulen

In the three months or so before the baby coo, stretching softly melodious sounds of "ah-ah-ah", "gu-in", "ah-ABM", "boo-y" and so on. Why does a child first says these sounds, and not some other? The fact that they are very simple to pronunciation and associated with sucking and swallowing. During Gulen arise joyful tone. The child begins gulit when a good mood, because he is well-fed, dry and have a good sleep.
In four months of sound combinations are becoming more complex, "STA-bre", "khn", "pH", etc. It is interesting that all children gulyat equally, regardless of nationality.. During this period, it crumbs reflects the sounds of all languages of the world. Later it will only use sounds that are characteristic of the native language.

Baby talk

In the fourth, the fifth month of Gulen gradually becomes babble. Sophomoric consists of syllable combinations, so the child imitates the speech of others. Peak babbling sounds of accumulation falls on the seventh month.

Severe speech impediments inhibit the development of babbling and it appears with a delay. In severe hearing impairment, Gulen stops, so you need to visit a neurologist.
With eight months to a year, and "piggy bank" new sounds almost not replenished. The child repeats different rhythmic chains several times implied, for example, "cha-cha-cha-cha," "ha-ha-ha", honing skills of pronunciation, while listening to yourself. Thus, the amount is gradually replaced quality. Appear the words with meaning, which means certain people, objects, actions. Pointing to the machine, said "BBC", "top" - walks, "boo" - falls, turning to his mother, he says "ma-ma" and so on..

Unlike Gulen, babbling consists of the sounds of the native language. Healthy Child says emotionally expressive. Communicating with adults, pipsqueak learn to mimic their intonation, rhythm and tempo of speech, to preserve the general shape of the word.
Therefore it is very important to maintain a set of revitalizing the baby, responding to his smile, constantly talk to the crumbs, developing his speech and later communicative.

Important! Wake-up call is a lack of understanding of speech addressed to the child!

Educational games it

There are special game exercises that promote proper development of speech:

"Who it?". The kid from the first days of life are interested in everything that is happening around. When will accumulate knowledge, ask him how to "say" cow, rooster, a tractor in his luggage. Then, put forth a riddle, emitting the sounds of "wow" meow "," th ", even guess who they belong to.
"Monkey". Go with the crumbs to the mirror and draw faces. Show how when eaten honey licked the little bear cubs. Clicked his tongue, like a horse. Imagine that tab - swing, shake them in different directions. All these movements - different exercises articulation exercises. 
Game "high-low" develops voice pitch and pronunciation onomatopoeic words. Her conduct in the street, taking with him a toy-mother with her cub. Hide and offer crumbs to find them. When will find, let describe their sound, they say, it is important to convey the tone (little mouse squeaks finer voice than his mother). And you will guess who tot found.
