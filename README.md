Moms-grandmother

It is impossible to deny the fact that many of the usual things change with the birth of the baby. First and foremost, we are beginning to try on new roles - we become moms and dads, and our parents - and grandparents.
Our parents are already included in the age expectations grandchildren would try
realize their desires, they hoarded inside themselves for a long time. In the Russian tradition of the family assumed that the education of children engaged mother and grandmother, and males are slightly suspended, plunging headlong into the job and about the family providing care to all necessary. Therefore I'd like to talk about the relationship of newly mothers and grandmothers, as they are often faced with a lack of understanding.

Kuta or not?

 The conflict between generations, usually begins to manifest itself in the first months after birth. Swaddle or not swaddle? Sleep with your child, or he should have his own bed? Kuta or temper? Breastfeed or a mixture? What is needed mode and whether it is necessary? Use diapers or not? New mom asking ourselves these questions every day, and there are more and more each day. So arranged that young parents attach great importance to the events occurring in the infant's life, and build your life around a child who is not only the center of the family universe, but also a bone of contention.
 
 Why is it that grandmothers and mothers are different views? Firstly, because of the age difference. Our parents operate information thirty years ago, when they lived in completely different conditions and had children by Spock. Science, medicine, the production of goods for children and parents do not stand still, held annually every new research and discoveries made in the field of pediatrics, psychology, innovative materials, etc. And it turns out that we ask for good advice to her grandmother, and she teaches us to tightly swaddle, dopaivat some water and do not take on his hands, "yell and stop."

And grandmother like to remember and saying: "Here you are at that age was very quiet and has rolled over, walked, danced, told verses" (underline). This, of course, the memory property to forget the bad and remember only the good. But we are already the parents, adults with a family and has been a long-awaited baby. And when my mother comes to us, communicating with it, we suddenly enter again in the role of a child suffering from a transitional age. That is why we are trying to assert themselves and to us so it is important to prove their case. And my mother, in turn, takes us seriously, because in front of her her own child, not so long ago (it does not matter that, thirty years passed like a flash), it was just as tiny and just cried in her arms. ( Why is the baby crying? )

Faced with the problem of misunderstanding and conflict situations, remember that first and foremost your family relations are an example for your child. Even three-month babies well feel your mood, they are very susceptible to the emotional state of the mother and the people around them, when people close to swear, baby begins to cry. Do you want this? Of course not. Try to agree in advance with your spouse and then, and with their parents about the rules and principles of education, which are close to you.

I am the way I am

If my grandmother too often tries to come to you and you do not like her insistence arrange a visitation schedule. And if, on the contrary, you would expect it from a part of the aid, and it comes to you "visit", do not forget the time in two weeks that she really has his own life and his plans for the weekend. Do not be offended by relatives - you only spoil your mood, but their own, you will never change. Take them for what they are. It is very difficult to find the strength, but try, because it affects the well-being of your child and your family. Although infants and do not understand the words, they feel stress and skin are not able to withstand the negative effects.

Often, if grandma is coming to help, which means that you play together with your baby, together to cook and clean the house. What is there to lie down, to meet with a friend or go to yoga! My grandmother used to the fact that motherhood - it is hard work, not fun - it is this idea has always been handed down from generation to generation. Remember, the conditions in which we grew up, when there were no washing machines, diapers, our parents, when their fathers died in the war and the mothers themselves pulled on itself a huge family. Talk about your feelings and desires, because if you keep silent, my grandmother never understand itself, what you want.

For the baby it is important to feel the genuine love that comes from an adult, so remember that no nurse does not replace a loving grandmother. A child needs to feel the connection between generations and to be a part of a big family.
