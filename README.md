When the "bloom" kidney

During the summer, the load on the kidneys is increased due to the fact that we are hot, we drink more than usual. All nine months, these bodies are working for two - mother and baby. What are the problems most often concerned moms? Is it possible to avoid the aggravation of kidney disease? How to be treated at the time of the child's expectations? The answers to these questions can be found in the article.

Common kidney disease in pregnant
During pregnancy increases the renal pelvis, ureters have decreased tone. The uterus grows and disrupts the normal flow of urine, the conditions for bacteria. Together with these dual load changes often lead to failure in the kidney and provoke the appearance and development of diseases. The most common kidney disease in expectant mothers are as follows.

Renal glycosuria
Kidneys - it filters that passed through a blood, leaving the nutrients and removing waste. However, due to the increased load, they can not hold all the glucose and return it to the blood. filtration rate is increased and absorption remains the same, however the kidney loses a certain amount of glucose, which goes into the urine and eliminated from the body. Urine tests show its presence. This problem is not related to diabetes, because blood sugar is within normal limits. Such a state is not a threat and will soon pass on their own.

During renal glycosuria pregnant does not feel any discomfort. Doctors tend to simply monitor the level of sugar in the urine of pregnant and prescribed a diet with limited consumption of carbohydrates. Have to give up baking, reduce the amount of sweets, switch to fresh vegetables, fruits, berries, cereals.

Infectious diseases of kidneys and bladder
These diseases develop because of the penetration of the urogenital system infections. The condition can worsen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second and third trimesters.

    Asymptomatic bacteriuria (latent current). 

In the analysis of bacteria and exhibit an increased number of leukocytes. On the part of the pregnant woman no complaints. In this case, doctors take a urine test for bakposev that shows microbes cause inflammation. Ascertain their sensitivity to various antibiotics. After diagnosis prescribed treatment which comprises administering antibiotics. There are drugs approved for use during pregnancy, they do not have toxic effects on the fetus. This is confirmed by international studies major. If you leave the disease alone and allow the inflammation to develop further, it is possible to wait for purulent pyelonephritis, which already require surgery.

    Cystitis.

 Pregnancy - a time to a weakened immune system. Therefore, the body can not always resist the attack of bacteria. Due to the nature of the female anatomy, infection is very easy: the short urethra from the perineum bacteria get into the bladder, then matched to the kidneys. Symptoms appear:

Discomfort during urination,
pain in the abdomen,
sometimes the temperature rises.

Cystitis should be treated as an inflammatory process is dangerous for mother and baby. In the fight against this disease using antibiotics, uroseptiki, herbal.

    Pyelonephritis. 

He found one in three pregnant. Typically, an inflammation of the kidneys and urinary tract infection begins with the bladder and then up the ureter microbes higher in kidneys. Pyelonephritis occurs due to lower immunity, hormonal changes, and because of the gradual compression of the ureter uterus. Symptoms of pyelonephritis:

Nagging back pain,
high fever,
chills,
swelling,
increased pressure.

Diagnosis is based on urine, blood, ultrasound. Treatment consists of a course of antibiotics that should start drinking as soon as possible, because there is a risk of complications. Inflammation can cause:

    Chronic disease.
    Acute glomerulonephritis, ie loss of kidney glomeruli.
    Renal failure.
    Urolithiasis.

Toxicosis second half of pregnancy
One of the most serious complications of pregnancy is a late toxicosis, or preeclampsia. It is found in 30% of cases. Often for a long time the disease does not manifest itself in any way. Typically, preeclampsia symptoms occur after 20 weeks. Its features are:

    High blood pressure,
    protein in the urine,
    Fluid retention in the body.

Gestosis dangerous spasm of small blood vessels, resulting in a reduction in the amount of blood which carries oxygen and nutrients, and also organ function violated. A pregnant displaced fluid and electrolyte balance, there is swelling, thirst appears. Toxicosis second half of pregnancy affects the baby. Due to the poor performance of the placenta the child suffers from a lack of nutrients and elimination of toxins difficult. It can cause fetal hypoxia and slowing its growth and development.

A pregnant at this kidney disease often accumulate liquid in organs, tissues or cavities, disrupted kidney. Severe forms of preeclampsia should be treated in a hospital. Mild treatment is conducted using preparations to reduce the pressure and reduce edema.

Urolithiasis disease

This disease usually does not affect the pregnancy and the child's development. Stones are formed due to the violation of phosphorous-calcium metabolism, sedentary lifestyles, consumption purines, which is primarily in yeast, organ meats (kidney, liver, heart), poor environmental conditions. Urinary stone disease usually begins before pregnancy and has no symptoms. After conception it can manifest as renal colic, hematuria (appearance of blood urine).

If the stones in the kidney or ureter provoke the development of pyelonephritis, prescribe drugs antibacterial action. Cost special diet in case of occurrence of urolithiasis without complications. It is prescribed depending on the nature of the violation of mineral metabolism. Surgery for stone removal, if required, is carried out, usually after childbirth.

Glomerulonephritis
This develops renal disease after infectious respiratory disease due to exposure to cold, stress, and as a complication of pyelonephritis. Immunity is responsible for the introduction of microorganisms vascular lesions of the glomerular renal unit, resulting in reduced blood filtration quality, that triggers renal failure. Symptoms started pathological process may be:

    Low back pain,
    Unpleasant sensation during urination,
    The feeling of poor health,
    the weakness of the appearance,
    Headaches,
    A decrease in the volume of urine and change its color.
    The increase in pressure in the morning.

The acute form of renal disease in need of strict bed rest and specific therapy.
Important! If the temperature rises, there were swelling, pain, urinary problems urgently need to see a doctor. Check the condition of the body - to be tested regularly.

Diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases
In case of suspected renal disease prescribed:

    Urine. These include: general, bakposev at Zimnitskiy, Nechiporenko.
    Blood tests. Biochemical and clinical.
    Renal ultrasound. In order to assess their condition.
    ECG.
    Blood Pressure Measurement.

How will treat future mother? Doctor may prescribe:

    Suitable antibiotics, antispasmodics, diuretics.
    To activate the flow of urine used medicinal herbal diuretic action. Help: bearberry, cranberry leaf, mint, fennel seeds, and other plants. But before their use is necessary to consult a doctor, even a herbal treatment for kidney disease may be unsafe for pregnant women.
    Microbes and the salts are washed from the body abundant drink. Therefore, for kidney diseases recommended drink per day for at least two liters of liquid in the absence of contraindications. Drink water, juice, compote or fruit drink. Especially useful cranberry, it will have the antibacterial effect.
    Diet with restriction of salt and spicy food will also help the fight against kidney disease.

In some cases, you need a caesarean section?
The following pathological kidney condition exclude natural childbirth:

    The omission of the kidney in the pelvis,
    Fusion body (horseshoe kidney)
    Placental abruption due to high blood pressure.
    Fetal hypoxia.
    After plastic surgery to restore the bladder wall, which is absent.
