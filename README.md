But only added complexity: you begin to experience irritation, not only because, as a mother or mother in law applies to you, but also how it communicates with the baby. For example, too lisp, spoils or kept too cold. 

Relationships glowing even more if you take offense at my grandmother and all her will express. Try to do the right thing - to try to understand what psychological type it belongs to, and do not ask her more than she can give. Try her portrait busybody, business, and remote controller - see who is on the psychological type.

Tip!Make it clear grandmother that you respect her opinion, but are not obliged to follow its advice. Thank and say, what to think, you - the parent and is entitled to act in its own way.

Busybody

The first psychological type are very cute, good grandmother. The main business of their lives is to educate the grandchildren. They like to play with kids having fun swim, walk, bake cakes, knit booties and jackets, pampered and do not notice the children's pranks. Grandchildren from these grandmothers delighted. And while the child is in the stomach, they all love bring down upon you meet on the street with a warm shawl, so as not to catch cold, fed, watered almost spoon, free from the homework.

If you're more likely to thank them, quarrels noticeably diminished. Although you too can be unhappy with the fact that my grandmother too indulge their grandchildren and does not know the word "impossible". For example, she always cleans up after them toys, despite the high pressure .

Women of this personality type may not adhere to the strict rules and fundamental in the education of children. Therefore, to raise children yourself, and ask her grandmother did not intervene when you parse the behavior of a daughter or a son. Although it secret from you will still protect and comfort of their favorite grandchildren.

Business

These women love the same children and grandchildren, work and hobbies, her husband and friends. "Bury themselves within the four walls," they're not going. They are too boring to cook soups and darn socks. The meaning of life psychological type of business - their own development. However, this does not mean that this grandmother will not help you with the baby. It will be, but when there will be a "window" in the schedule - on weekends or on vacation. And on weekdays, it offers business!

Possible problems
Such a position may annoy you, but my grandmother has every right to it. Why should she refuse to work, which is the soul, where it is demanded and necessary? Or Qigong in the evening, if it helps keep the form?

This grandmother will not bake cakes for the grandchildren, but they can buy them. Instead gladly go with their grandchildren in the theater, museum or an exhibition. Hire and pay for themselves music tutor or English. Write down on development activities, make their grandchildren lessons.

Controller

If the grandmother "business" type does not give all of myself grandchildren, because he was doing himself, the "controller" gives, even when it is not being asked. She's bossy and authoritarian, he loves to teach others and to indicate how to proceed. Relationships with grandchildren are built the same way - they are based on the principle of unconditional submission.
But young parents with a grandmother can be calm, because it is unlikely to miss the feeding, developmental classes or massage.

Possible problems
Special difficulties will not arise if you have a soft compliant character and you sometimes want to hide under the strong wing. In this case, just do as she says. Difficulties arise and the "Battle of the Titans" can not be avoided if you have a complicated character.

Then displeased that the child wear a diaper, in which, in her opinion, it overheats. Or disables ready to feed your baby puree banks, believing that it alone preservatives!

After listening to her opinion, politely say, "Thank you, we think," you do not have to follow her advice. Parents have the right to do as they see fit. Grandmother, of course, be angry, but you are in a calm and friendly tone argues its opinion. In this case, keep confident, but not defiantly, then she will have no choice and it will start to communicate on an equal footing. "Controllers" back if they feel that they can not "lay" person on the blade.

Communication takes place only on the phone and the Internet, to see possible only twice a year. Mom interested in your life, delving into the problem of not very deep. However, some grandmother despite the distance control of your life, demanding to call 10 times a day and report what they were doing and where they were. Immediately after birth, the grandmother can come for a week to visit, then, most likely, he would go back. After all there in her house, farm.

Possible problems
You are upset because the other mothers are involved in caring for the baby, and your mom does not know about it. She still does not arrive, even though you already fall from exhaustion. Alas, there were circumstances that it is there and you are here.
Not Taita insults at her grandmother and the fate of the villain, better look for a babysitter. Even if two or three hours a day, the child will spend with nanny, it will greatly facilitate your life. A child should not see your resentment at her mother-in-law. On the contrary, do everything possible to ensure that the baby knew the grandmother he has, it is far from easy. Then each of the meeting will be a holiday.
