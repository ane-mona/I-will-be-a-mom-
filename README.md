The first family conflict 

What will be discussed does not apply to women with Rh positive blood. But if the lady negative Rh and planned pregnancy or already have, then it is better read this article carefully. As will be described Rh disease, which is very dangerous!

What is Rh-conflict?

It appears between mother and fetus. If a woman has Rh positive, the risk for the baby there, and in this case a negative Rh may be the Pope, and even a child. Also, the danger can not be held "double" Rh negative, when the blood of both parents with a minus sign. The danger can only arise if the mother is a carrier of negative rhesus, and the child wants to take my father's positive. 

People with Rh + majority of the world 85%, Rh- have only 15% of the population. Rh factor - this is a special protein that is found on the surface of red blood cells (red blood cells). The difference is that people with a positive Rh this protein is, but in "negative" it is not.

The appearance on the boy born with Rh negative does not bother, because minus in this case is no worse than a plus. But if a girl has inherited Rh, her parents worried, because in the future she give birth.

Rhesus-conflict reminiscent of the armed conflict. The fact that the immune system of the pregnant woman with a negative Rhesus struggling with Rh-positive fetus. It is perceived as a hostile agent from which you want to get rid of. During pregnancy in the mother's blood enter the baby's blood cells, which can not be avoided. The immune system of a woman directs specific antibodies to destroy the nascent body. The woman, this war will have no effect, but the child is in danger. Even if he survives, he will be born with serious diseases. Can suffer brain, liver, nervous system, heart, kidneys.

Therefore, careful monitoring of pregnant Rhesus negative. Well, that under the Rh conflict of mother and fetus such danger - a rarity. Also it helps reduce risks prevention.

The first, second ...

Doctors antenatal clinic, only to put on record a pregnant woman, immediately sent her to take blood from a vein on the definition of the group and rhesus. Future father's blood is examined as well. If a woman has Rh negative and a man - is positive, the doctor must demonstrate to a pregnancy special attention. Panicking in any case it is not necessary, especially during the first pregnancy.

Statistics says that the first birth experience Rhesus conflict only in 1.5% of cases. The mother's body can produce two types of antibody: IgM and IgG. In the first pregnancy, Rh-conflict, as a rule, does not arise. As highlighted antibodies type IgM, which due to its large size it is difficult to overcome the placental barrier. It gets a small amount, which is insufficient for the emergence of Rhesus-conflict.

At each subsequent pregnancy, if not to carry out prevention, the risks increase. The number of antibodies increases and already dominated by small antibody type G, which easily crosses the placenta and the blood of the baby. However, this does not mean that women with negative Rhesus factor is not worth thinking about the second, and even more the third baby. As, however, we must not forget about the low risk during the first pregnancy.

Recommendations

If you become pregnant, and the expectant mother has Rh negative, you must:


    Right to be registered in the antenatal clinic. On the eighth week regularly donate blood from a vein to determine antibody titer. The greatest danger arises from the 28th week of pregnancy, when the fetus is enhanced blood circulation and antibodies act more intensively than before. Up to 32 weeks of blood is necessary to hand over every month after that period - twice a month, in the ninth month - weekly. Donate blood at the appointed time, because the sooner the blood appear antibodies and the more they become, the greater the risk to the fetus.
    Do not skip doctor visits, time going through all of the studies (ultrasound, CTG, doplerometrii).
    At 28 weeks of pregnancy is required to enter the Rh immunoglobulin to stop the production of antibodies.

If a child is born with Rh positive, you must re-enter the Rh immune globulin to help prevent Rhesus conflict in subsequent pregnancies. If the birth took place with complications (cesarean section, twins , bleeding) will need two doses of Rh immunoglobulin.

Intrauterine study

Rh conflict is detected by a blood test. A baby suffering degree - by hardware studies. Ultrasound will determine whether there is hemolytic disease of the fetus, what its degree of development. US negative results, i.e. the presence of disease markers (increase in the liver, the blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery in the fetus) - a reason for assigning invasive diagnostic methods: cordocentesis or amniocentesis. They cause complications, but other diagnostic methods do not.

Planning for pregnancy

Rh- women with pregnancy should be planned with all the responsibility and monitor it closely. Before conception:

    Do not allow abortion. With each pregnancy antibodies in the blood becomes larger.
    Beware blood transfusion even if it is the same monkey. It can be an antibody.
    No later than 3 days after the miscarriage , abortion, ectopic pregnancy, blood transfusions, childbirth make an injection into the muscle of the human Rh immunoglobulin D.

To date, the problem of pregnancy with Rh-conflict mother and fetus is very urgent. Due to weak awareness of the majority of women find out about the possibility of prevention is very late, when it was impossible to do anything, but remains to be seen.

Prevention of complications

Scientists have shown that the Rh factor in the unborn child is laid at 6 weeks of gestation. Urgent prevention with the introduction of immunoglobulin required a woman:

    If there are complications in this period. For example, which began miscarriage (any bleeding), cervical incompetence, which requires suturing the cervix.
    If you have to invasive diagnostics. For example, at high risk by screening.
    With the introduction of immunoglobulin at the very beginning of pregnancy require repeated administration at 28 weeks.

Hemolytic disease of the fetus without treatment causes fetal death. But today there are treatments even edematous form of the disease, which is the most severe and leads to death in 98% of cases. Therefore, during pregnancy with Rh-conflict give birth to relatively healthy baby is still possible if the expectant mother to ensure careful monitoring and control.
