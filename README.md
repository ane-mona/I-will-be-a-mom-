Why the child often spits up?

Mom's anxiety turns to the doctor for the answer to this question, but he calmly replies that regurgitation are the norm. However, the omission can hurt. If this happens too often, crumbs threatening dehydration. Rectify the situation can be with the help of properly selected mixture and antireflux diet.

What causes vomiting in children?

When the baby was in my mother's belly, it fed the cord through her nutrients directly absorbed into the bloodstream. After birth, these functions began to carry out the digestive tract. Moving down, the food broken down into components and digest. From the first days of life the stomach bowel studying to fully work, are not excluded and failures. Regurgitation, ie, reflux - one of them.

If the child vomits, but this is accompanied by a stable set of weights, then nothing to worry about. However, the constant regurgitation leads to weight loss and inhibit development. This is a violation of doctors correct in two ways, designate:

    antireflux food;
    developed a special diet.

Help the crumbs stick to the doctors advice, ee while feeding.

Why the child vomits?

There are several causes of reflux:

    The immaturity of the lower esophageal sphincter. In this connection, the contents of the stomach is thrown up into the esophagus and throat. Gradually, the structure and function of the digestive tract are improved, usually by 4-5 months of life is no longer a problem.
    Prematurity. Body baby still fragile, so it can not absorb food in new ways.
    Hypoxia. Oxygen deficiency in a child can cause pathology of the nervous system.
    Abnormalities in the structure of the digestive system. Some of them are completely on their own, others require surgical intervention that happens, fortunately, quite rare.

Antireflux mixture 

Regurgitation can restrain the anti-reflux formula. Thickening of the stomach contents - their main task.

    Dining with a greater proportion of casein. The mixture comprises whey protein and casein, the amount of the latter is increased. Under the influence of gastric acid casein turns into cheesy flakes, slips into a viscous mass.
    Foods low in fat. It slows the function of the lower sphincter that provokes vomiting. However antireflux power does not imply a complete absence of fat. Just it a little less than usual.
    The addition of a thickener. The mixture was added corn, potato or rice starch. Due to the gastric juice becomes thick, making it difficult to return the food back. Starch is sometimes replaced by the resulting bean carob gum.

One time believed that the additive in the antireflux mixtures slow down the absorption of calcium, iron and zinc. But recent studies have shown that this theory is not without foundation.

Mom Tips for feeding your baby

If regurgitation is small, then for your baby, do not worry. But if the child
"returns" almost the entire portion, it is worth considering whether you feed it properly.

    When feeding from a bottle, it must be held so that all contained a mixture of the nipple. Otherwise, the air gets into the intestines and cause regurgitation and colic.
    Baby feeding small portions, but often. Regurgitation may occur due to the small size of the stomach, a surplus of food results in a reduction of its walls.
    After feeding, wait for the pipsqueak otrygnet air. Hold it in an upright position for 20 minutes During this time, you can walk around the room and mingle, and you get a lot of positive emotions.
    Lift one end of the cot where the baby's head is located, and lock it in this position.
