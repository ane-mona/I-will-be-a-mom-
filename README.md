What can I eat?

Meat and fish only in the stew, baked and cooked. Now is not the time to lose weight, animal fat should be present in the menu. Therefore, a sandwich with butter and cheese will come in handy.

New diet certainly will seem bland and tasteless. If, instead of cooking to use a roasting dish will be much tastier. Seasoning can be green .
Tip! Do not think that diet has become poorer and a lot of things have to give. Enjoy your present situation and not notice how time flies breastfeeding.

Expansion Policy diet

At a time in the diet only add one new product. Because if the baby
will arise an allergic reaction, it will be difficult to determine exactly which product has caused it. So we have to eliminate all of the components. Complex dishes, in which a lot of ingredients, can contain multiple allergens that trigger a baby in a violent allergic reaction.

If the body tot he "did not notice", the next day, eat whole fruit. If, and this time everything went well, it is possible to conclude that the product does not cause allergies and can be administered in the diet. However, to increase the dose should also be gradual.

If after 2-3 days a rash or peeling brown, dry skin, red cheeks and thin, greenish with mucus stool, then eat them to become possible only after half a year after the use of a new product on the baby's skin.
