Damage refined products (2 h) 

In this part we will focus on refined oil and rice, as well as those useful products that can replace them with success.

Refined vegetable oils

To maximize squeeze from sunflower seeds and canola oil, their first organic solvent is poured called hexane. Then try to remove residual solvent vapor and alkali solution. Thereafter, the product was subjected to refining, i.e. purification, which disappears when most of the nutrients (minerals, vitamins, chlorophyll, lecithin). That oil has become clear, light yellow color, it is bleached. Additionally filtered and deodorized by removing odor.

Sunflower and rapeseed refined oil is very popular due to marketing tricks. The labels are full of attractive slogans that cholesterol-free product and preservatives. Of course it is, because in all plant foods, in principle, it can not be. Cholesterol is only found in animal products. And what about the lack of preservatives can be answered as follows: a product and does not need them, since it has been repeatedly subjected to chemical treatment.

We look for replacement

Unrefined olive oil is rich in oleic acid (unsaturated fatty acid omega-9). It is well absorbed, has beneficial effects on metabolism, blood vessels, blood cholesterol levels. The olive oil contains most of the omega-9 group fatty acids. With their help it is possible to get rid of carcinogens to normalize blood pressure , a prophylaxis of diabetes and obesity.

The unrefined olive oil rich in vitamins A, D, K, which are necessary for laying the tissues and organs of the fetus. With their help the developing bone, organ of vision, regulates cell growth and development. It possesses antioxidant vitamin E also prevents the formation of thrombi.

The most useful unrefined olive oil, it is obtained by a mechanical method, when heated of not more than 27 degrees (cold pressed). This category is designated oil:

     Extra Virgin,
     Fine virgin olive,
    Semi-fine virgin olive oil.

To save all the useful substances, such oils should be consumed only in salads, not subjecting to heat treatment.

Linseed oil refined

Cold pressing can save a unique natural combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3, omega-6, lecithin, phytosterols, beta-carotene. Linseed oil leads to normal lipid metabolism, it stops the development of diseases of the digestive and cardiovascular systems. Also refined linseed oil improves the elasticity of blood vessels that is necessary for the prevention of varicose veins , stroke, infarct, high blood pressure. 

Linseed oil is refined with regular use has a positive effect on the function of the brain, the retina of fetal eyes.

Take unrefined flax seed oil can be mixed with milk products, juices. For example, constipation need a glass of yogurt, add 1 tsp oil and drink before going to bed. Flaxseed oil is added to thesalads , soups, garnishes, thus not subjected to high temperatures, to preserve the structure of the fatty acids.

Peeled rice

Polished white rice is a refined product. When processing a
surface grain shell removed and a part of the embryo. In them there is a large amount of vitamins and minerals. Therefore, from the polished rice dishes are less useful, despite the best razvarivaemost cereals and absorption of carbohydrates.

Polished rice - the most refined product. During the processing of grain it remains
only inside of the grain, which is called endosperm. In it 60% starch,
only a small proportion of proteins and other nutrients.

The refined white rice a little mineral substances, almost no vitamins and absolutely no fiber.
When polishing the rice lost to:

     70% thiamine (vitamin B1) 
     30% - B2,
     50% - PP.

Upon receipt of the polished grain loss even more.

Replacing refined rice

Brown (brown) rice obtained by the method of peeling sparing shell in
which most of the vitamins and the shell mineralov.Otrubnaya grain remains, and with it, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, B vitamins
Brown rice richer in nutrients than white refined , it
 contains more:

    At 2.5 times the potassium;
    3 times vitamin B6 and E;
    1.5 p. vitamin B1;
    The 4.5 p. fiber.

Fiber is essential for gastrointestinal health. Edible fiber prevent colon cancer, obesity, constipation .

Brown rice sheath contains antioxidants that lower blood cholesterol levels, a surplus output, reduce its uptake than prevent the development of heart and vascular diseases as well as obesity.

Keep in mind that brown rice is not stored for a long time (since the present composition of fatty acids), and since the stored tissue sheath and preparing for longer refined.

How to cook brown rice?

Soak rice useful in cold water and leave overnight. In the morning, drain the water, pour
fresh (three times more than rice) and put on ogon.Cherez 10-15 minutes after boiling check for availability. It should be slightly undercooked. Turn off gas, close the lid tightly, and leave for another 10-15 minut.Zatem drain and rinse under running cold water using a colander. When the drain water transfer to a pan which has roasted until golden brown onions. Season with salt and pepper, stir and heat.

Wild rice is black, it is very appreciated for its membership. It has a lot of protein: 100 g - 15, thanks to a lot of folic acid, in great demand by pregnant women. The black rice it is 5 times more than in the drill - daily intake is placed in a beaker. Wild rice is rich in minerals:

    magnesium - 178 mg (50% RDA),
    Zinc - 7 mg
    manganese - 1.4 mg.

In conclusion, I want to draw attention to a pregnant woman to useful non-refined products at a time when it takes the bad habit of refined with the store shelves.
