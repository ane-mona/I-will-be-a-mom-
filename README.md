indifferent voice said, "So ... Mom ... you will ...". We get information and immediately phoning his wife if he did not close, parents, friends. What if this event to make a holiday? It's a good excuse to once again get together with loved ones and spend time with them, because then it will not be so much.

And why do we have?

In America, already have such a holiday, it is called «Gender Reveal Party» (in translation from English means "festival dedicated to the definition of sex"). How did he pass?
It is possible to agree with the doctor, so he wrote on a piece of paper and put a floor baby leaf in an envelope. Then you need to include the note in the confectionery, where bake a cake. During the party, you can play different games, chat, and then split into two teams. One team will be "for the girl" and the other - "a boy". Then you cut the cake, you can see the color of the filling, and the secret becomes immediately apparent. You can also entrust the organization of the holiday agency, which is now quite a lot. (It so happens that all wanted a girl, and a boy was born, or vice versa. The reasons for this desire and councils upset parents read this article).

Surprise ...

Well, if you absolutely can not stand and want to learn the news directly to the doctor's office, so be it, learn, but keep it a secret from everyone. And try to organize a holiday for yourself. And we can help you with this ideas:

    Team. Ask guests to wear pink or blue shirts or if it is not very convenient, prepare for them a different color accessories - be it hair clips, headbands, you can cut and making a mustache, lips, or points on the sticks of pink and blue.

Let him get up behind you, hug you, and put his hands on his tummy. Ask you to take a picture. And then let him raise his hands up, and the second shot will be clear who are you waiting for - a son or daughter. It seems a great idea to announce the long-awaited news to friends in social networks !

    Clothes for the baby. Another way to tell guests about sex baby - deployed in front of them a bundle of clothes. Buy in the children's department of the right color clothes and wrap it in pretty paper. Expand the parcel in front of guests at a party or have your future grandparents.
    
      If you already have an older child, involve it in the process. It happens that the birth of a brother or sister's mixed feelings for the older. And at this moment it is very important to feel needed and main. Make the inscription on a T-shirt - "I will have a brother (or sister)." Let the elder wears a t-shirt, and on top of any jacket with a zipper. At the climax, he unbuttons his jacket - and that, ladies! All amazed and happy!

    Balloons. Buy bulbs with the expectation of each guest. Before you inflate balls, put them in confetti pink or blue. Give each guest balls and pins.

In the hour of X, open the box, fly balls, and guests will know you will be a little prince or princess.

    Bow or drawing. If you do not want to collect the guests, but simply to announce the news to the future pope in an unusual way, you can tie a ribbon tummy gift pink or blue color or draw on her belly image that tells your partner whom you waiting for - a daughter or a son.
