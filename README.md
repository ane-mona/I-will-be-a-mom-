In this regard, the breast milk it a little bit (which is not true of cows' milk and mixtures).

there are nutrients in breast milk - amino acids. The most important of these are taurine and lactoferrin. Origin promotes brain and nervous system, pituitary, auditory nerve, fat digestion. The second helps the body to assimilate iron, inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and toxins, components thereof, derived from the urine, destroy microbes genitourinary system.

DNA building material is contained in the protein, nucleotides. Thanks to their normal functioning intestines, liver, pancreas.
